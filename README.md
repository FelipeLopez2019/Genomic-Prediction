R-Scripts for Genomic Prediction 

MODUS OPERANDI

Run the first the Descriptive Analysis (Descriptive.Rmd) using the supplied data. Then, run the genomic prediction analysis (Prediction_v2.Rmd).

LIST OF ELEMENTS:

The R-notebook Genomic Prediction_v2.Rmd is related to Genomic Prediction

The R-notebook Descriptive.Rmd is related to Descriptive analysis of phenotypic data and the R-script to convert the molecular variants to genetic relations matrix

The genetic relations matrix is named: GAPIT.Kin.VanRaden.csv

The molecular variants dataset in numeric format is named: GAPIT.Genotype.Numerical.txt

The molecular variants dataset is named: X.hmp.txt

The phenotypic data is named:
YLP.xlsx
